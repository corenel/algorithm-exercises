    Sort array in ascending order by insertion sort

    Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element
    each repetition, and growing a sorted output list.
    At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element
    from the input data, finds the location it belongs within
    the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until
    no input elements remain.

def shell_sort(array):
    """
    Sort array in ascending order by shell sort

    Shell Sort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort.
    In insertion sort, we move elements only one position ahead.
    When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements
    are involved. The idea of shellSort is to allow exchange
    of far items. In shell sort, we make the array h-sorted
    for a large value of h. We keep reducing the value of h
    until it becomes 1. An array is said to be h-sorted if
    all sub-lists of every hâ€™th element is sorted.
