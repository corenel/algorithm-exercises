Classical Knapsack Problem
---
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity
W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two
integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights
associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents
knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of
the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an
item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Unbounded Knapsack problem
---
Given a knapsack weight W and a set of n items with certain value val[i] and
weight wti, we need to calculate minimum amount that could make up this
quantity exactly. This is different from classical Knapsack problem, here we
are allowed to use unlimited number of instances of an item.

    """
    A naive recursive implementation of 0-1 Knapsack Problem

    A simple solution for 0-1 knapsack problem  is to consider all subsets
    of items and calculate the total weight and value of all subsets.
    Consider the only subsets whose total weight is smaller than W. From
    all such subsets, pick the maximum value subset.

    To consider all subsets of items, there can be two cases for every
    item:

    1. the item is included in the optimal subset.
    2. not included in the optimal set.

    Therefore, the maximum value that can be obtained from n items is
    max of following two values.

    1. Maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W weight (excluding
       nth item).
    2. Value of nth item plus maximum value obtained by n-1 items and
       W minus weight of the nth item (including nth item).

    If weight of nth item is greater than W, then the nth item cannot
    be included and case 1 is the only possibility.

    It should be noted that the recursive version function computes the
    same sub-problems again and again. Time complexity of this naive
    recursive solution is exponential (2^n).
